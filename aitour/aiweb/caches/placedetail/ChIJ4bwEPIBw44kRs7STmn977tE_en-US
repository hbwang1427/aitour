The museum is interesting if a bit sparse on actual historic items, but the active portraits and holographic actors make up for it.  They do have the only remaining tea chest from the Tea Party.  The period actors were thoroughly enjoyable and engaging.  And Abigail's Tea Room was the perfect treat on a 33 degree day after being outside in the sleet.  Spent 6 days in Boston and this was the highlight of the trip...much better than many other attractions in the city.",

The scones were a little dry but they were tasty nevertheless. Thanksgiving sandwich was to die for. Really great. \n\nThe bottomless tea meant you could try all five types of tea that were tipped into the harbor during the protest. Our server was very knowledgeable on the subject and gave us some great context of the teas, who would be drinking them and quality tasting notes. \n\nThere were fun games on the table for people to play. So one could conceivably spend a couple of hours chilling out in the atmosphere. \n\nWe didn't have time to do the whole tour, but we could hear it occasionally, and it sounded like fun. \n\nRecommended.",

The tour cast plays their parts well and do a good job of drawing those in the tour group into the experience. Especially good for children but I'm a middle aged male and I enjoyed it as well.",
